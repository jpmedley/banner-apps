    <h1>Web App Install Banner Sample</h1>

    <p>Available in <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/features/4540065577435136">Chrome 42+ (for Android)</a></p>

    <p>The web app install banner will prompt the user to add your web app to the users home screen.
    It will only prompt when a number of criteria have been met:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The app uses a service worker</li>
      <li>The site is using SSL</li>
      <li>The app has a manifest declared</li>
      <li>The manifest has a `short_name`, 144 pixel icon and a type of 'image/png'</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To see if this example works, come back in another day and you will see the banner.</p>
    <p>If you are impatient and would like to force the banner to appear for testing purposes visit chrome://flags/#bypass-app-banner-engagement-checks</p>
